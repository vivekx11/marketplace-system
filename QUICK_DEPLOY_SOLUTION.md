# 🚀 Quick Solution: Make Your App Work on All Devices....

## Problem
Your app currently uses `localhost:3001` which only works on the same computer.

## ✅ FASTEST SOLUTION: Use ngrok (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Install ngrok
1. Download from: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Extract and place `ngrok.exe` in your project folder
3. Or install via: `choco install ngrok` (if you have Chocolatey)

### Step 2: Start ngrok
```bash
# In a new terminal, run:
ngrok http 3001
```

You'll see output like:
```
Forwarding  https://abc123.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 3: Copy Your Public URL
Copy the `https://abc123.ngrok.io` URL

### Step 4: Update Both Apps

**User App** - Edit `user_app/lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://abc123.ngrok.io/api';
```

**Shop Owner App** - Edit `shop_owner_app/lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'https://abc123.ngrok.io/api';
```

### Step 5: Rebuild Apps
```bash
cd user_app
flutter build apk --release

cd ../shop_owner_app
flutter build apk --release
```

### Step 6: Install & Test
```bash
adb install user_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
adb install shop_owner_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## ✅ DONE! Your app now works on ANY device, ANY network!
