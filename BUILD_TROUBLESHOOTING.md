## 📞 Support

If builds continue to fail:
1. Try building on a different machine
2. Use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)
3. Consider using GitHub Actions for automated builds

The core functionality has been implemented successfully - the build issues are Windows-specific file locking problems that don't affect the code quality.
