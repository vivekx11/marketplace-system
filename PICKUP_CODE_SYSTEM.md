3. System verifies code validity
4. Displays order details for confirmation
5. Shop owner confirms and processes payment
6. Order marked as completed

## 💳 Payment Flow

### Payment Security
- Order is confirmed before payment
- Shop owner can verify order contents
- Customer can inspect items before paying
