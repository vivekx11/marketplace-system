# Complete Testing Guide - Marketplace System....

## 🎯 Overview

This guide will help you verify that both apps work correctly with:
- ✅ No dummy data
- ✅ Real API integration
- ✅ Proper offline handling
- ✅ Complete shop and product management
- ✅ Order flow from user to shop owner

## 📋 Pre-Testing Checklist

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Create .env file with MongoDB connection
npm start
# Backend should be running on http://localhost:3001
```

### 2. Get Your Computer's IP Address

**Windows:**
```bash
ipconfig
# Look for IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig
# Look for inet address
```

### 3. Update API URLs

**User App** - Edit `user_app/lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.100:3001/api';
// Replace with YOUR IP address
```

**Shop Owner App** - Edit `shop_owner_app/lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://192.168.1.100:3001/api';
// Replace with YOUR IP address
```

### 4. Build Both Apps
```bash
# User App
cd user_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release

# Shop Owner App
cd shop_owner_app
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### 5. Install on Device
```bash
adb install user_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
adb install shop_owner_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```
