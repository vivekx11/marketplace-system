## 📱 Backend API Requirements

Your backend must have these endpoints:

### Shop Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/shops              - Register new shop
GET    /api/shops              - Get all registered shops
GET    /api/shops/:id          - Get shop details
PUT    /api/shops/:id          - Update shop
DELETE /api/shops/:id          - Delete shop
```

### Product Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/products           - Add new product
GET    /api/products           - Get all products
GET    /api/products/shop/:id  - Get products by shop
PUT    /api/products/:id       - Update product
DELETE /api/products/:id       - Delete product
```

### Order Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/orders             - Create order
GET    /api/orders/shop/:id    - Get shop orders
GET    /api/orders/user/:id    - Get user orders
PUT    /api/orders/:id/status  - Update order status
POST   /api/orders/verify-pickup - Verify pickup code
```

### User Endpoints:
```
POST   /api/users              - Register user
GET    /api/users/:id          - Get user details
PUT    /api/users/:id          - Update user
```

## 🚀 Complete Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
# Update .env with your MongoDB connection
npm start
```

### Step 2: Update API URLs

**User App** - `user_app/lib/core/constants/app_constants.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:3001/api';
// Replace YOUR_IP with your computer's IP address
// Example: 'http://192.168.1.100:3001/api'
```

**Shop Owner App** - `shop_owner_app/lib/services/api_service.dart`:
```dart
static const String baseUrl = 'http://YOUR_IP:3001/api';
```

### Step 3: Firebase Setup
Both apps need Firebase configuration:
- Authentication (for OTP if needed)
- Storage (for product images)
- Follow the guides in each app folder

### Step 4: Build Apps
```bash
# User App
cd user_app
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release

# Shop Owner App
cd shop_owner_app
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release
```

### Step 5: Install & Test
```bash
adb install user_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
adb install shop_owner_app/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

## 🧪 Testing Workflow

### Test Shop Owner App:
1. Install and open app
2. Register shop with all details
3. Upload product with image, price, quantity, description
4. Verify product appears in shop
5. Wait for user orders
6. Test offline mode (turn off WiFi)

### Test User App:
1. Install and open app
2. Enter username
3. Verify only registered shops appear
4. Browse products from shop owner
5. Place an order
6. Test offline mode (turn off WiFi)

### Test Offline Behavior:
1. Turn off WiFi/Mobile data
2. Open app
3. Should see "You are offline" message in center
4. Try to load data - should show offline error
5. Turn on network
6. Pull to refresh - data should load

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Shop Owner App → Backend API → Database
                      ↓
User App ← Backend API ← Database
```

### Shop Registration Flow:
```
Shop Owner fills form → POST /api/shops → MongoDB → Success
```

### Product Upload Flow:
```
Shop Owner selects image → Firebase Storage → Get URL
Shop Owner fills details → POST /api/products (with image URL) → MongoDB
```

### Order Flow:
```
User selects products → POST /api/orders → MongoDB
Shop Owner sees order → Accept/Reject → PUT /api/orders/:id/status
User picks up → Shop verifies code → Order completed
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Verify Backend is Running**: Make sure all API endpoints work
2. **Update API URLs**: Change localhost to your IP address
3. **Test Shop Registration**: Register a shop and verify in database
4. **Test Product Upload**: Upload product with image
5. **Test User Flow**: View shops and products as user
6. **Test Offline Mode**: Verify offline messages appear correctly

## 📝 Important Notes

- **No Dummy Data**: All data comes from backend API
- **Offline Detection**: Real-time network monitoring
- **Image Upload**: Uses Firebase Storage
- **Order Management**: Real-time updates
- **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for all scenarios

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "No shops found"
**Solution**: Register a shop using shop owner app first

### Issue: "No products available"
**Solution**: Upload products using shop owner app

### Issue: Images not uploading
**Solution**: Check Firebase Storage configuration

### Issue: API errors
**Solution**: Verify backend is running and API URL is correct

### Issue: Offline message not showing
**Solution**: Check NetworkService initialization in main.dart
